Humans of Trantor aims to be a backbone on which Engineers of Trantor can build
products for development of our colleagues.

HoT is an experimental implementation of an [[https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html][event-sourced]] system employing [[https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html][CQRS]],
recording and publishing *all* events that happen with humans (not just
employees) of Trantor. We want to encourage developers of Trantor to hack their
lives here at Trantor. If you feel something needs fixing in your everyday lives
at Trantor (attendance system anyone?), get creative and fix it. Or just play
around with data.

HoT itself just keeps track of all the events that happen with humans of
Trantor.
