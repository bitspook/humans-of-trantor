# UI

Simple UI for adding standup updates.

I am creating it in a rush right now, because Abhishek Verma is all the way up our ass all the time
for filling up the timesheet. Here's the list of nasty shortcuts I am taking:

1. **Directly event injection from frontend**: This should never happen in a production app.
   Although, not that I am starting it for the sake of getting-shit-done, it is very likely to
   become a norm. But better go the not-ideal way than not move forward at all.
