Hot CLI is created to perform certain operations which don't have a UI yet. To install the CLI,
execute these commands:

```sh
cd cli
yarn
yarn link
```

Provided you have [yarn bin directory](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/global/) in your `$PATH`, this will add `hot` command to your terminal.
Proceed with `hot help` for guidance on how to use it.
