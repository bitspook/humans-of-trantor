HoT is a cloud of independent components. Each component is a containerized
docker application. HoT cloud can be created locally using docker-compose.

So basic knowledge of docker (to containerize your application) and
docker-compose (to interact with rest of the cloud) is required.

To add your application to the cloud (to reach the core HoT services), please
add an entry to the docker-compose.yml file.

Following should be installed on your system to work with HoT.

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
2. [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
